ARIF is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) lending protocol that enables users to borrow and lend **without collateral**.  
Our **AI-powered Risk Engine** ingests and interprets **on-chain activity in real time**, synthesizing behavioral patterns and transaction histories to generate a **risk score** that lenders can rely on.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Collateral-free borrowing** – accessible lending without the need for locked assets.  
- **AI Risk Engine** – real-time scoring based on on-chain behavior and transaction history.  
- **Decentralized & Transparent** – built on smart contracts to ensure trustless execution.  
- **Secure for Lenders** – lending decisions guided by risk assessments rather than guesswork.

## 🛠️ Architecture
- **Smart Contracts** – manage loan creation, repayments, and lender/borrower interactions.  
- **Risk Engine** – off-chain AI model that analyzes blockchain data, generates scores, and feeds into lending logic.  
- **Frontend dApp** – simple UI for borrowers and lenders to interact with the protocol.
